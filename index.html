    <p>  I am Java Developer. I am constantly learning, looking for ways to improve, and finding ways to solve complex problems. My passion is creating things, such as web programs, websites, and rock songs in my band Playing to Vapors.</p>         
    <p>  It was my alt-rock peers that introduced me into the world of coding. Since then I have become enthralled with the creative process of solving problems using software technologies. </p>        
    <p> Currently, I am learning as much as I can about the tech world at a 14 week coding bootcamp called Tech Elevator. Once I finish I aim to find a career where I can be creative and learn from passionate individuals like myself.</p>
